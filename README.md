"EDSM_lib.py" - Some functions to interface python with EDSM

"LP trilateration.py" - uses the lib as an example, trilaterate coordinates of the point of origin of the LP messages

"LP trilateration monte carlo.py" - another example, using uniform distributed points inside bounding box volume to calculate target volume, center and radius

"material finder by body.py" - uses Canonn DB to look for a specific material in geo/bio sites within a certain radius of a system and then optimizes the route with mlrose TSP
